    "    * \\<package name\\> = ``DES``, \\<file name\\> = ``Differential_Equation_Solver.py``, \\<description\\> = Code to solve ODEs\n",

    "* To install a package, follow the following steps:\n",
    "1. Navigate to the directory that your BasicCode folder is in. Make a folder there called \\<package name\\>, then make a folder within \\<package name\\> that is also named \\<package name\\>.\n",
    "2. Download \\<file name\\> from my GitHub page at https://github.com/hannahrasmussen/package_name (insert package name of interest into the URL) and put it in the folder within the folder.\n",
    "3. In the folder (not the folder within the folder), put a ``setup.py`` folder with the following code:\n",

    "5. Once you’re there, type and enter ‘pip install -e .’ (including the period). That ‘-e’ extension means that updates you make to the code are automatically also installed, which is obviously what we want.\n",
    "6. Now, to see if it worked, restart your jupyter notebook kernel in ``RunVarCode.ipynb`` and try and do ‘from \\<package name\\> import \\<file name\\>’. If there are no errors, you can delete that line and should be good to run the code as is."

    "    * Creates a mass array (``ms``) with a single index of 300 MeV\n",
    "    * Creates a mixing angle array (``mixangle``) with a single index of $5 \\times 10^{-5}$\n",
    "    * Prints the mass of the sterile neutrino in units of MEV and the lifetime of the sterile neutrino in units of seconds\n",
    "    * Sets the file name (``fn``) where the data will be saved as the code is running\n",
    "    * If the file ``fn`` doesn't already exist, the code then creates the file\n",
    "    * If the file ``fn`` does exist, a warning statement is printed that any existing data in the file will be overwritten\n",

The first is this is the number of times ``DES.destination_x_dx`` is called *per* ``driver`` run (if we don't break out of ``driver`` sooner). The second is that this is the number of steps ``DES.destination_x_dx`` *saves* per ``DES.destination_x_dx`` run. Here we set $N_s = 100$.\n",
    "        * ``dNs`` = Becomes ``dN_steps`` in ``driver``, so this is the number of steps ``DES.destination_x_dx`` takes between saved steps. Here we set $\\Delta N_s = 100$. In total, ``babysteps`` ultimately calls ``driver`` $N_{\\rm runs}$ times, ``driver`` calls ``DES.destination_x_dx`` $N_s$ times, which saves $N_s$ ODE solutions, and goes through another $\\Delta N_s$ steps between saved steps. I believe that's a maximum of $200*100*100*100 = 2 \\times 10^8$ runs of ``derivatives``, wow!!\n",

In theory, ``xp`` is either this OR an array of length two whose first index represents the last $\\epsilon$ value where ``y_v[i]``<``y_v[i+1]`` and whose second index represents the $\\epsilon$ value right after this, with ``yp`` containing the corresponding $f$ values, if these indices are *after* ``eps_small_new``. However, I don't think the latter would ever happen second because if ``y_v`` was still increasing after ``eps_small_new``, then ``eps_small_new`` would just be bigger; also this again doesn't deal with the case where there are no values of $f$ greater than $10^{-30}$, maybe they just should never all get that small? idk\n",

    "    * The if statement after the while loop basically checks if the final $f$ value is greater than the second to last $f$ value; if this is the case the epsilon array probably needs to be made longer at some point. The case where all $f$ values are greater than $10^{-30}$ seems like it would fall into this if statement when it probably shouldn't, so it seems like we're making two assumptions here: one that it will never be the case that all $f$ values are less than $10^{-30}$ and one that it will never be the case that all $f$ values are greater than $10^{-30}$, can we safely make this assumption?\n",

We break out of the for loop when the extrapolated $f$ value tested is not greater than $10^{-40}$.

    "    * If ``decay_on`` is ``True`` (if the sterile population is still decaying at a non-negligible rate), then the if statement after ``new_len`` is set makes sure that ``new_len`` is big enough to account for $\\epsilon = (m_s/2)*a$, the $\\epsilon$ value of the highest energy neutrino decay product, which is that of decay process $\\nu_s \\to \\nu + \\gamma$. \n",
    "    * ``new_len``: The length of the new $\\epsilon$ array, ``eps_array``.
